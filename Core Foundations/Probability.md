# Probability

Probability is the foundation of uncertainty in AI and statistics. It measures how likely an event is to occur and plays a critical role in tasks such as predictive modeling, decision-making, and machine learning algorithms.

##  **What is Probability?**

Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event, denoted as \( P(A) \), ranging between \( 0 \) (impossible event) and \( 1 \) (certain event). It is calculated as:

\[
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total possible outcomes}}
\]

## **Core Concepts of Probability**

### 1. Events and Outcomes
- **Experiment**: A procedure with well-defined outcomes (e.g., rolling a die).
- **Sample Space (\( S \))**: Set of all possible outcomes.
- **Event (\( A \))**: A subset of outcomes from \( S \).

**Example**:
- Rolling a die (\( S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \)).
- \( A = \{ \text{"Rolling a 3"} \} \), where \( P(A) = \frac{1}{6} \).

---

### 2. Types of Probability
- **Theoretical Probability**: Based on known possibilities (e.g., coin toss).
  - Example: \( P(\text{Heads}) = \frac{1}{2} \).
- **Experimental Probability**: Based on observed data.
  - Example: Flip a coin 100 times, \( P(\text{Heads}) = \frac{\text{Number of Heads}}{100} \).
- **Subjective Probability**: Based on intuition or prior knowledge.

```python
import random

# Simulating Coin Toss for Experimental Probability
trials = 1000
results = [random.choice(["Heads", "Tails"]) for _ in range(trials)]
experimental_p_heads = results.count("Heads") / trials
print(f"P(Heads): {experimental_p_heads}")
```

---

### 3. Rules of Probability

#### (a) Addition Rule
If \( A \) and \( B \) are two events:
\[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
\]

#### (b) Multiplication Rule
The probability of \( A \cap B \):
- If \( A \) and \( B \) are **independent**, \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \).
- If \( A \) and \( B \) are **dependent**, \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B|A) \).

```python
# Example of Events
P_A = 0.4  # Event A
P_B = 0.5  # Event B
# Independent Events
P_A_and_B = P_A * P_B
print(f"P(A and B): {P_A_and_B}")
```

---

##  **Probability Distributions**

Probability distributions categorize data into **discrete** or **continuous** distributions to measure probabilities of outcomes.

### 1. Discrete Distributions
Probability is assigned to discrete (countable) outcomes.

#### (a) Binomial Distribution
Counts the number of successes in \( n \) independent trials with success probability \( p \).
\[
P(X = k) = C(n, k) \cdot p^k \cdot (1-p)^{n-k}
\]
```python
from scipy.stats import binom

# Binomial Distribution Example
n = 10   # Trials
p = 0.6  # Probability of success
k = 5    # Number of successes
binom_prob = binom.pmf(k, n, p)
print(f"P(X = {k}): {binom_prob}")
```

#### (b) Poisson Distribution
Measures the probability of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.
\[
P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
\]
```python
from scipy.stats import poisson

# Poisson Distribution Example
lambda_rate = 3  # Average rate
k = 2  # Number of events
poisson_prob = poisson.pmf(k, lambda_rate)
print(f"P(X = {k}): {poisson_prob}")
```

---

### 2. Continuous Distributions
Probability is assigned over a range of values.

#### (a) Normal Distribution
Symmetrical, bell-shaped curve characterized by mean (\( \mu \)) and standard deviation (\( \sigma \)).
\[
\text{PDF: } f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
\]

```python
from scipy.stats import norm

# Normal Distribution Example
mu, sigma = 0, 1  # Mean and Std Dev
x = 0.5  # Value for which probability is computed
prob = norm.cdf(x, loc=mu, scale=sigma)
print(f"P(X <= {x}): {prob}")
```

#### (b) Exponential Distribution
Used for measuring time until an event occurs (e.g., time between arrivals of customers).

##  **Bayes’ Theorem**

Bayes’ Theorem is a method to update probabilities as new information becomes available.
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

**Example**: Diagnose the probability of having a disease after a positive test result.
```python
# Bayesian Probability
prior = 0.01  # P(Disease)
sensitivity = 0.95  # P(Positive | Disease)
specificity = 0.90  # P(Negative | No Disease)
p_positive = (sensitivity * prior) + ((1 - specificity) * (1 - prior))
posterior = (sensitivity * prior) / p_positive
print(f"P(Disease | Positive Test): {posterior}")
```

##  **Common Tricks and Tips for Probability**

1. **Visualize Distributions**
   - Always visualize distributions using histograms, PDFs, or PMFs for clarity.
   - Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn.
   ```python
   import seaborn as sns
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   data = norm.rvs(loc=0, scale=1, size=1000)  # Normal distribution samples
   sns.histplot(data, kde=True, bins=20)
   plt.title("Normal Distribution")
   plt.show()
   ```

2. **Simulate Probabilities in AI**:
   - Use Monte Carlo simulations to estimate complex probabilities.

3. **Approximation**:
   - Use Normal Approximation for Binomial distributions when \( n \) is large:
     \[
     N(\mu = np, \sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)})
     \]

4. **Conditional Independence**:
   - Recognize cases where events can simplify using conditional independence.

5. **Understand Sampling**:
   - Random sampling affects probabilities. Bootstrapping can improve estimations of population statistics.

6. **Use Libraries**:
   - Tools like `scipy.stats`, `numpy`, and `pandas` simplify probability calculations.

##  **Applications of Probability in AI**

1. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Models like Naive Bayes and Bayesian Networks heavily rely on probability theory.

2. **Markov Chains**:
   - Probabilities over sequences of events (e.g., state transitions).

3. **Reinforcement Learning**:
   - Decision-making under uncertainty uses probabilistic policies.

4. **Uncertainty Estimates**:
   - Probabilistic models quantify uncertainty in AI predictions.
