# Gradient Descent Hacktricks

Gradient Descent is an essential optimization algorithm used in machine learning and deep learning to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent (negative gradient). It is widely employed for minimizing cost functions in regression, neural networks, and other predictive models.

## ðŸš€ **What is Gradient Descent?**

Gradient Descent is a first-order optimization algorithm used to minimize an objective function \( f(x) \). The algorithm updates the model parameters iteratively based on the gradient of the cost function to find the optimal value of parameters.

- **Goal**: Minimize the cost/loss function \( J(\theta) \) with respect to model parameters \( \theta \).
- **Stepping Rule**: Adjust parameters in the direction of the negative gradient:
  \[
  \theta = \theta - \eta \nabla J(\theta)
  \]
  where:
  - \( \eta \): learning rate (step size).
  - \( \nabla J(\theta) \): gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters \( \theta \).

## ðŸ§© **Variants of Gradient Descent**

### 1. **Batch Gradient Descent**
- Updates parameters using the **entire dataset** in each iteration.
- **Formula**: \( \theta = \theta - \eta \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \nabla J_i(\theta) \)
- **Pros**: Stable convergence.
- **Cons**: Computationally expensive for large datasets.

---

### 2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**
- Updates parameters using **one data point** at a time.
- **Formula**: \( \theta = \theta - \eta \nabla J_i(\theta) \)
- **Pros**: Faster for large datasets.
- **Cons**: Noisy convergence (can overshoot the minimum).

---

### 3. **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**
- A compromise between Batch GD and SGD. Uses a **small batch of data points** for each update.
- **Formula**: \( \theta = \theta - \eta \frac{1}{B} \sum_{i=1}^{B} \nabla J_i(\theta) \)
  (where \( B \) is the batch size)
- **Pros**: Faster and more stable convergence.

---

## ðŸ’¡ **Tricks and Best Practices**

1. **Choose a Proper Learning Rate (\( \eta \))**:
   - Too large: Could overshoot the optimal point.
   - Too small: Convergence becomes too slow.
   - **Trick**: Use adaptive methods like learning rate scheduling or optimizers (e.g., Adam or RMSProp).

2. **Gradient Clipping**:
   - Prevent exploding gradients by capping the gradient values.
   - Example: Clip gradient norms to a fixed maximum (e.g., 5).

3. **Dynamic Learning Rate**:
   - Reduce the learning rate as training progresses (e.g., exponentially or using a plateau strategy).

4. **Normalization**:
   - Normalize input features to speed up convergence (e.g., scale data to zero mean and unit variance).

5. **Momentum in Gradient Descent**:
   - Add a momentum term to avoid oscillations and accelerate convergence:
     \[
     v_{t+1} = \beta v_t - \eta \nabla J(\theta)
     \]
     \[
     \theta = \theta + v_{t+1}
     \]
   - Here, \( \beta \) controls how much of the previous gradient to retain.

## ðŸ”§ **Quick Code Examples**

### Example 1: Basic Gradient Descent Implementation (Vanilla)
```python
import numpy as np

# Define the cost function (e.g., y = x^2)
def cost_function(x):
    return x**2

# Define the gradient of the cost function
def gradient(x):
    return 2 * x

# Gradient Descent Settings
x = 10  # Starting point
learning_rate = 0.1
iterations = 100

# Perform Gradient Descent
for i in range(iterations):
    grad = gradient(x)
    x = x - learning_rate * grad
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}: x = {x:.4f}, Cost = {cost_function(x):.4f}")
```
- **Output**:
  - \( x \) gets closer to **0** (global minimum).
  - Cost decreases on each iteration.

### Example 2: Using Gradient Descent for Linear Regression
```python
# Gradient Descent for Linear Regression
import numpy as np

# Example Dataset
X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
y = np.array([3, 6, 9, 12])

# Parameters
theta = 0  # Initial weight
learning_rate = 0.01
iterations = 100

# Gradient Descent
for _ in range(iterations):
    prediction = theta * X
    cost = (1 / len(X)) * np.sum((prediction - y) ** 2)
    gradient = (2 / len(X)) * np.dot((prediction - y), X)
    theta -= learning_rate * gradient

print(f"Final Weight (theta): {theta}")
```

### Example 3: Automating Gradient Descent with `scipy.optimize`
```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Objective Function
def cost_function(x):
    return x**2 + 3*x + 5

# Scipy's minimize (uses gradient-based methods by default)
result = minimize(cost_function, x0=0, method='BFGS')

# Prints the optimal value of x
print("Optimal x:", result.x[0])
print("Minimum cost:", result.fun)
```

## ðŸ“š **Advanced Variants of Gradient Descent**

### 1. **Adaptive Gradient Descent Algorithms**:
- **Adam**:
  - Combines momentum and adaptive learning rate.
  - Well-suited for large-scale neural networks.
- **RMSProp**:
  - Scales the learning rate based on moving averages of recent gradients.
  - Works better in non-convex problems.
- **Adagrad**:
  - Adapts learning rates based on frequently updated parameters.

### 2. **Conjugate Gradient Descent**:
- More efficient for large, sparse problems.

## âš¡ **Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them**

1. **Vanishing or Exploding Gradients**:
   - Ensure numerical stability by normalizing inputs.
   - Use advanced optimization methods like Adam or RMSProp.

2. **Getting Stuck in Local Minima**:
   - Happens with non-convex problems.
   - **Fix**: Add random initialization or use momentum-based gradient descent.

3. **Slow Convergence**:
   - Tuning the learning rate, using momentum, or switching to variants like Adam can help.

4. **Inefficient Computation for Large Datasets**:
   - Opt for Mini-Batch Gradient Descent to balance speed and stability.
