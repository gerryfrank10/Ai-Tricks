# Machine Learning Methodology

Machine Learning (ML) development follows a systematic methodology to ensure the creation of robust, efficient, and interpretable models. This methodology includes multiple phases, from defining the problem to deploying and monitoring a trained model.

### 0. **Problem Definition**

Clearly identifying the problem is the first critical step in the ML pipeline. Define:
1. The **objective** of the model:
   - Classification, regression, clustering, etc.
2. The **questions your model should answer**:
   - Example: "Can we predict customer churn in the next three months?"
3. The **performance metrics** to evaluate success.

Some examples of ML problems:
- Predict loan defaults (binary classification).
- Forecast stock prices (time series prediction).
- Group customers into clusters for marketing (clustering).

References:
- Define goals and business objectives in your project documentation.

### 1. **Data Collection**

Collect data that is relevant to the problem. Data can come from:
- **APIs**:
  ```python
  import requests
  response = requests.get("https://api.sample.com/data")
  data = response.json()
  ```
- **Web Scraping**:
  ```python
  from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
  import requests

  url = "https://example.com"
  html_content = requests.get(url).text
  soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, "html.parser")
  print(soup.prettify())  # Scrape content from a website
  ```
- **Databases**:
  ```python
  import sqlite3
  conn = sqlite3.connect("example.db")
  query = "SELECT * FROM data;"
  df = pd.read_sql(query, conn)
  ```

**Key considerations**:
- Ensure data privacy and compliance (e.g., GDPR).
- Validate data completeness and quality.

---

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**

Data preprocessing converts raw data into a format suitable for modeling. It typically includes:
1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   ```python
   df = df.fillna(df.mean())  # Replace missing values with mean
   ```

2. **Removing Outliers**:
   ```python
   from scipy import stats
   df = df[(np.abs(stats.zscore(df)) < 3).all(axis=1)]  # Remove outliers using Z-score
   ```

3. **Scaling and Normalization**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
   scaler = MinMaxScaler()
   scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(df)
   ```

4. **Feature Encoding**:
   ```python
   pd.get_dummies(df, columns=["categorical_feature"])
   ```

**Code Guide**: Detailed steps can be found here: [Text Preprocessing Guide](Text-Preprocessing.md)

### 3. **Model Selection**

Model selection is the process of picking the best algorithm/framework for the task at hand.

**Key Considerations**:
- For classification:
  - [Logistic Regression](Logistic-Regression.md),[Decision Trees](Decision-Trees.md), [Random Forests](Random-Forest.md), etc.
- For regression:
  - [Linear Regression](Linear-Regression.md), Gradient Boosting, etc.
- For image/text data:
  - Deep Learning Models like CNNs or transformers.

**Example**:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
```

**Tip**:
Use libraries like **GridSearchCV** or **Optuna** to fine-tune model hyperparameters.

### 4. **Model Training**

Split data into training and validation/testing sets:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

Training a classification model:
```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

For deep learning:
```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=X_train.shape[1], activation="relu"))
model.add(Dense(1, activation="sigmoid"))  # Binary classification output
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="binary_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

### 5. **Model Evaluation**

Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using **metrics**:
- For classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
- For regression: RMSE, RÂ² Score.

**Example**:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, mean_squared_error
print(classification_report(y_test, model.predict(X_test)))

# Regression example
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred, squared=False)
print(f"RMSE: {rmse}")
```

Use cross-validation for reliable results:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)
```

Reference file: [Model Evaluation Metrics](Model-Evaluation.md)

### 6. **Model Optimization**

Optimize model performance by:
1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

   param_grid = {"max_depth": [3, 5, 10], "learning_rate": [0.01, 0.1, 0.2]}
   grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5)
   grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Removing unimportant features.
   - Creating new derived features.

3. **Model Ensembling**:
   Combine predictions from multiple models for better performance.

### 7. **Model Monitoring and Maintenance**

Deployed models require ongoing monitoring to detect issues like:
- **Data Drift**: When the input data changes over time.
- **Model Performance Degradation**.

**Example**:
Set up logging for real-time monitoring:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logging.info("Model performance is within acceptable range.")
```

Tools: Use **MLFlow** or **Prometheus** for model monitoring.

### 8. **Model Interpretation and Explainability**

Understanding the model's decision-making process is crucial, especially in industries requiring high accountability (e.g., healthcare, finance).

**Tools for Explainability**:
- **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations):
  ```python
  import shap
  explainer = shap.Explainer(model, X_test)
  shap_values = explainer(X_test)
  shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test)
  ```

- **Feature Importance**:
  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.barh(features, model.feature_importances_)
  plt.show()
  ```
